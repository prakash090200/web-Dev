    <p id ="a">A wiki (/ˈwɪki/ (About this soundlisten) WIK-ee) is a hypertext publication collaboratively e
        dited and managed by its own audience directly using a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages for the subjects or scope of the project and may be either open to the public or limited to use within an organization for maintaining its internal knowledge base.

     Wikis are enabled by wiki software, otherwise known as wiki engines. A wiki engine, bein
        g a form of a content management system, differs from other web-based systems such as 
        blog software, in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and w
        ikis have little inherent structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs 
        of the users.[1] Wiki engines usually allow content to be written using a simplified mar
        kup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor.[2] There are do
        zens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software,
        h as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are open source, whereas others are 
        proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for 
        example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may
         permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may be imposed to organize content.
         The online encyclopedia project Wikipedia is the most popular wiki-based website, a
        nd is one of the most widely viewed sites in the world, having been ranked in the top
         ten since 2007.[3] Wikipedia is not a single wiki but rather a collection of hundreds
          of wikis, with each one pertaining to a specific language. In addition to Wikipedia, 
          there are hundreds of thousands of other wikis in use, both public and private, including 
          wikis functioning as knowledge management resources, notetaking tools, community websites,
           and intranets. The English-language Wikipedia has the largest collection of articles: as of 
           February 2020, it has over 6 million articles. Ward Cunningham, the developer of the first wiki </p>
